# Ensuring Container Uptime

> In the previous scenarios we've launched some containers, but like any process, containers can crash. This scenario will explore how you can keep containers live and automatically restart them if the crash unexpectedly.

---

# Step 1 - Stop on Fail

## Example

We've created a special container which outputs a message and then exts with code 1 to simulatea a crash. Run the following command to launch the instance: `docker run -d --name restart-default scrapbook/docker-restart-`

If you list all the containers, including stopped, you will see the container has crashed `docker ps -a`

While the logs will output our message, which in real-life would hopefully indicate information to help us diagnose the issue.
`docker logs restart-default`

### Terminal Output

```bash
$ docker run -d --name restart-default scrapbook/docker-restart-example

# Restart on Fail

The option --restart=on-failure:# allows you to say how many times Docker should try again. In the example below, Docker will restart the container three times before stopping.
`docker run -d --name restart-3 --restart=on-failure:3 scrapbook/docker-restart-example)`

## Example

The option `--restart=on-failure:# --restart=on-failure:3
